**Title:** C# Image Processing Fourier Transform Library

**Description:**

This library provides efficient implementations of the Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) for image processing applications in C#. It enables you to analyze and manipulate images in the frequency domain, unlocking various image processing techniques like filtering, noise reduction, edge detection, and more.

**Features:**

* **2D Fast Fourier Transform (FFT2):** Efficiently transforms an image into its frequency domain representation.
* **Inverse Fast Fourier Transform (IFFT2):** Reconstructs an image from its frequency domain representation.
* **Frequency Domain Filtering:** Applies filters to modify image properties based on frequency components.
* **Magnitude and Phase Extraction:** Separates the magnitude (intensity) and phase (orientation) information in the frequency domain.
* **Normalization:** Normalizes magnitude and phase images for visualization.

**Installation:**

1. Clone this repository using `git clone https://github.com/MortezaMaghrebi/FFT2-Fast-Fourier-Transform.git`.
2. Include the project directory in your Visual Studio solution or reference the `ImageProcessingFourier.dll` assembly in your project.

**Usage:**

1. **Reference the libraries:**

   ```csharp
   using ImageProcessingFourier;
   using Fourier;
   ```

2. **Create an instance of `ImageProcessingFourier.FFT2`:**

   ```csharp
   ImageProcessingFourier.FFT2 IPF = new ImageProcessingFourier.FFT2();
   ```

3. **Perform FFT on your image:**

   ```csharp
   Bitmap image = // Load your image using System.Drawing
   IPF.fft2(image);
   ```

4. **Apply filtering (optional):**

   ```csharp
   double[,] filter = // Define your filter (e.g., low-pass, high-pass)
   IPF.Filter(filter);
   ```

5. **Perform inverse FFT to reconstruct the image:**

   ```csharp
   Bitmap processedImage = IPF.ifft2();
   // Display or save the processed image
   ```

**Additional Notes:**

* The `Fourier.cs` file (not provided) likely contains helper functions for complex number operations and FFT calculations.
* Consider including examples for magnitude, phase extraction, and visualization for enhanced clarity.
* Provide documentation for the specific functions in `Fourier.cs` if they are not self-explanatory.

**Examples:**
